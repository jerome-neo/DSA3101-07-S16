LiftSim is a data science project aimed at improving elevator efficiency and reducing wait times in multi-floor 
buildings, particularly, S16 building at the National University of Singapore (NUS). By utilizing statistical modeling 
techniques and simulation software, LiftSim provides valuable insights into elevator performance and management. 

## Quick start
