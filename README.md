## 1. Introduction
LiftSim is a data science project aimed at improving elevator efficiency and reducing wait times in multi-floor 
buildings, particularly, S16 building at the National University of Singapore (NUS). By utilizing statistical modeling 
techniques and simulation software, LiftSim provides valuable insights into elevator performance and management. 

Our goal is to revolutionize the way elevators are managed, and provide building managers with the tools and insights 
needed to optimize their elevator operations. With LiftSim, building managers can effortlessly simulate different 
elevator management strategies, and analyze the impact of those strategies on elevator throughput and wait times. 
By empowering data-driven decisions, LiftSim helps building managers to maximize efficiency, reduce wait times, and 
improve the overall experience for elevator users.
